  Write, fix, or extend automated tests for this Home Assistant custom integration using pytest and
  pytest-homeassistant-custom-component. Use when asked to "add tests", "write a test", "the tests fail", "improve
  coverage", "add a regression test", "test the config flow", "update snapshots", or when a behavioural change
  needs verification before it can be called done. Covers the tests/ layout, the conftest.py fixtures this project
  needs, mocking the API client, config flow and entity test patterns, registry assertions, syrupy snapshots,
  freezing time, and the script/test commands. SYMPTOMS — load this if you are about to: instantiate an entity
  class directly instead of asserting on `hass.states`; write a test without `enable_custom_integrations`; use
  `time.sleep` instead of `async_fire_time_changed`; silence a DeprecationWarning to make the suite pass; or
  commit a snapshot you have not read.

# Testing

Home Assistant tests are integration tests by nature: you load a real config entry into a real `hass` instance and
assert on `hass.states` — not on Python objects.

**Read [`blueprint.tests.instructions.md`](../../instructions/blueprint.tests.instructions.md) first** — it
holds the rules: directory mirroring, pytest markers, the fixture names, how a test is written (types, no branches, no
network), the core-interface rule, registry assertions, what to mock and what never to mock, and the command list. This skill is the
scaffolding and the judgement calls.

## When a test is required

- Behavioural change, bug fix, or regression → add a proportionate test.
- **A bug fix starts with a failing test.** Write it, watch it fail for the reported reason, then fix — a test written
  after the fix may never have been able to fail.
- Documentation-only, formatting-only, or anything that cannot affect runtime → no test needed.
- If a test is impractical (needs real hardware, non-deterministic timing), say so explicitly and describe the residual
  risk. Do not silently skip it, and never claim coverage that does not exist.

## The shared fixtures: `tests/conftest.py`

Use these by name instead of defining a variant per file — every existing test depends on them:

- `auto_enable_custom_integrations` — autouse; without `enable_custom_integrations` a custom integration does not load
  in a test at all.
- `config_entry` — a `MockConfigEntry`, not yet added to `hass`.
- `mock_api` — the `AsyncMock` that stands in for the data source; set `return_value` or `side_effect` per test.
- `init_integration` — adds `config_entry`, sets it up with `mock_api` active, and returns the loaded entry.

A library client instead of our own needs a different `mock_api` — see
[`references/recipes.md`](references/recipes.md#mock_api-for-a-third-party-library-client). Recorded payloads go in
a `fixtures/` folder: `load_fixture("device.json")` and `load_json_object_fixture("device.json")` resolve against the
one next to the calling test file. Never pass `DOMAIN` as their second argument — that points at Core's
`tests/components/<domain>/fixtures/`, which does not exist here.

## Layout

`tests/` mirrors `custom_components/<domain>/`:

```text
tests/
├── conftest.py
├── fixtures/                  # recorded API payloads
├── test_init.py               # setup, unload, reload, migration
├── test_config_flow.py        # user, reauth, reconfigure, options, discovery
├── test_diagnostics.py        # snapshot + redaction
├── sensor/test_air_quality.py
└── snapshots/                 # syrupy .ambr files, committed
```

## Patterns

### Setup and unload lifecycle

```python
async def test_setup_and_unload(hass: HomeAssistant, init_integration: MockConfigEntry) -> None:
    """The entry loads and unloads cleanly."""
    assert init_integration.state is ConfigEntryState.LOADED

    assert await hass.config_entries.async_unload(init_integration.entry_id)
    await hass.async_block_till_done()
    assert init_integration.state is ConfigEntryState.NOT_LOADED
```

### Setup failure

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    ("error", "expected_state"),
    [
        pytest.param({ClassPrefix}ApiClientCommunicationError, ConfigEntryState.SETUP_RETRY, id="unreachable"),
        pytest.param({ClassPrefix}ApiClientAuthenticationError, ConfigEntryState.SETUP_ERROR, id="bad-credentials"),
    ],
)
async def test_setup_failures(
    hass: HomeAssistant,
    config_entry: MockConfigEntry,
    mock_api: AsyncMock,
    error: type[Exception],
    expected_state: ConfigEntryState,
) -> None:
    """Client failures map onto the right entry state."""
    mock_api.side_effect = error
    config_entry.add_to_hass(hass)
    await hass.config_entries.async_setup(config_entry.entry_id)
    await hass.async_block_till_done()
    assert config_entry.state is expected_state
```

### Entity state

```python
async def test_sensor_state(hass: HomeAssistant, init_integration: MockConfigEntry) -> None:
    """The sensor exposes the coordinator value."""
    state = hass.states.get("sensor.example_device_pm25")
    assert state is not None
    assert state.state == "12.3"
    assert state.attributes[ATTR_UNIT_OF_MEASUREMENT] == UnitOfDensity.MICROGRAMS_PER_CUBIC_METER
```

Never instantiate an entity class directly — go through `hass.states`. Compare units against the `homeassistant.const`
constant, never a typed literal: `µ` (U+00B5) and the `μ` (U+03BC) Home Assistant uses look identical and compare
unequal.

### Every entity of a platform

`snapshot_platform`, and the `entity_registry_enabled_by_default` fixture it needs, are in
[`references/recipes.md`](references/recipes.md#every-entity-of-a-platform-snapshot_platform).

### Config flow

```python
@pytest.mark.usefixtures("mock_api")
async def test_user_flow(hass: HomeAssistant) -> None:
    """The happy path creates an entry."""
    result = await hass.config_entries.flow.async_init(DOMAIN, context={"source": SOURCE_USER})
    assert result["type"] is FlowResultType.FORM
    assert result["step_id"] == "user"

    result = await hass.config_entries.flow.async_configure(
        result["flow_id"],
        {CONF_USERNAME: "test-user", CONF_PASSWORD: "test-password"},
    )
    assert result["type"] is FlowResultType.CREATE_ENTRY
    assert result["result"].unique_id == "test-unique-id"
```

Parametrise the error branches (`invalid_auth`, `cannot_connect`, `unknown`) and always assert that the flow **recovers**
— show the form again with the error, then succeed on the second attempt. `config-flow-test-coverage` (Bronze) expects
every step and every abort reason to be exercised.

### Time-driven updates

```python
freezer.tick(DEFAULT_SCAN_INTERVAL)
async_fire_time_changed(hass)
await hass.async_block_till_done()
```

Use the `freezer` fixture (`pytest-freezer`, typed `FrozenDateTimeFactory`) and `async_fire_time_changed`.
`time.sleep()` in a test is always wrong.

### Snapshots

```python
async def test_diagnostics(
    hass: HomeAssistant,
    hass_client: ClientSessionGenerator,
    init_integration: MockConfigEntry,
    snapshot: SnapshotAssertion,
) -> None:
    """Diagnostics output is stable and redacted."""
    assert await get_diagnostics_for_config_entry(hass, hass_client, init_integration) == snapshot
```

Snapshots are for large stable structures (diagnostics, entity registry dumps). They complement functional assertions;
they do not replace them. Regenerate with `script/test --snapshot-update` and **read the diff** before committing the
`.ambr` file — an accepted snapshot of a bug is worse than no test.

### Repair issues

Assert through the `issue_registry` fixture: `issue_registry.async_get_issue(DOMAIN, issue_id)` is not `None` after the
trigger, and is `None` again once the condition clears.

## Two settings that surprise people

**Warnings are errors, and so are Home Assistant's own deprecations.** `filterwarnings = ["error"]` in
`pyproject.toml` fails the suite on a Python `DeprecationWarning`, which catches libraries. Home Assistant's own
deprecations — a removed helper, a deprecated constant, a wrong-thread call — are **logged** instead:
`Detected that custom integration '<domain>' …` from `report_usage()`, or `The deprecated … was used from <domain>`
from the deprecation helpers. The autouse `fail_on_deprecation_report` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` fails every test
whose `caplog` holds such a record. A path no test reaches still needs the runtime log — see
[`ha-modern-apis`](../ha-modern-apis/SKILL.md#fixing-a-deprecation-warning). Fix the cause; never filter the message.

The one exception to "warnings are errors" is a warning **Home Assistant Core raises about its own use of a library it
pins**, which no change here can fix and which would otherwise block every test that touches that subsystem — the
aiohttp warnings from `homeassistant/helpers/aiohttp_client.py` and `homeassistant/components/http/` are the ones
already ignored. Before adding one, confirm the warning's origin is a Core file and not this integration; a warning
about our own code stays an error. Then key the ignore to the exact message rather than the category, and say in a
comment where it comes from and why it cannot be fixed here — a bare `DeprecationWarning` ignore also hides the next
real deprecation.

**`asyncio_mode = "auto"`**, so async tests need no `@pytest.mark.asyncio`.

The command list is in the instructions file.

## Coverage priorities

Order of value, highest first: config flow branches → setup/unload/migration → coordinator error translation → entity
state and availability → service action error paths → diagnostics redaction. Chase behaviour, not a percentage.

## Do not

- Do not mock `aiohttp` at the transport level when mocking the client is enough — you end up testing your mock.
- Do not assert on log output as a substitute for asserting on state.
- Do not commit a snapshot you have not read.
- Do not report coverage you did not measure, or describe a test as passing without running it.

The remaining rules are in
[`blueprint.tests.instructions.md`](../../instructions/blueprint.tests.instructions.md).
