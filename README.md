## Getting Started - Creating Your Integration

Ready to create your own Home Assistant integration? **First, create your own repository from this template**, then choose one of two development options:

- **Option 1: GitHub Codespaces** ☁️ - Develop in the cloud (browser-based, zero install, recommended for beginners)
- **Option 2: Local DevContainer** 💻 - Develop on your machine (requires Docker + VS Code)

Both options use the same DevContainer setup, so your code and workflow are identical!

### Step 0: Create Your Repository First! 🎯

**Before you start developing**, create your own repository:

1. Click the **"Use this template"** button at the top of this page
2. Choose a name for your integration repository (e.g., `hass-my-awesome-device`)
3. Click **"Create repository"**

Now you have your own copy to work with! Continue with Option 1 or Option 2 below.

### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended for Beginners) ☁️

Develop directly in your browser without installing anything locally!

1. In **your new repository** (created in Step 0), click the green **"Code"** button
2. Switch to the **"Codespaces"** tab
3. Click **"Create codespace on main"**
4. **Wait for setup** (2-3 minutes first time) - everything installs automatically
5. **Run `./initialize.sh`** in the terminal to configure your integration
6. **Follow the prompts** to customize:
   - **Domain**: Your integration's unique identifier (e.g., `my_awesome_device`)
   - **Title**: Display name (e.g., "My Awesome Device")
   - **Repository**: Your GitHub repo (e.g., `yourusername/your-repo`)
   - **Author**: Your name for the LICENSE

7. **Review and commit** your changes in the Source Control panel (`Ctrl+Shift+G`)

**That's it!** You're developing in a fully configured environment with Home Assistant, Python 3.13, and all tools ready. No local setup needed!

> 💡 **Pro tip:** Codespaces gives you 60 hours/month free for personal accounts. Perfect for integration development!
>
> 🌐 **Port forwarding:** When you start Home Assistant (`script/develop`), port 8123 will automatically forward and you'll get a notification with the URL.
>
> 🧹 **Auto-cleanup:** After initialization completes, the setup script removes itself automatically.
>
> 📖 **More details:** See [Codespaces Development Guide](docs/development/CODESPACES.md) for tips, troubleshooting, and differences from local development.

### Option 2: Local Development with VS Code

If you prefer working on your local machine (requires Docker + VS Code):

#### Prerequisites

You'll need these installed locally:

- **Docker Desktop** (or compatible Docker engine)
- **VS Code** with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- **Git**

#### Setup Steps

1. **Create your repository** from this template (click "Use this template" at the top)

2. **Clone in a Dev Container**:
   - In VS Code, press `F1` and select: **"Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Named Container Volume..."**
   - Enter your repository URL
   - Wait for the container to build (2-3 minutes first time)

3. **Run `./initialize.sh`** in the terminal to configure your integration

4. **Follow the prompts** to customize:
   - **Domain**: Your integration's unique identifier (e.g., `my_awesome_device`)
   - **Title**: Display name (e.g., "My Awesome Device")
   - **Repository**: Your GitHub repo (e.g., `yourusername/your-repo`)
   - **Author**: Your name for the LICENSE

5. **Review and commit** changes in Source Control (`Ctrl+Shift+G`)

6. **Start developing**:

   ```bash
   script/develop  # Home Assistant runs at http://localhost:8123
   ```

> **Note:** Both Codespaces and local DevContainer provide the exact same experience. After the container is ready, run `./initialize.sh` to customize your integration. The only difference is where the container runs (GitHub's cloud vs. your machine).

Then customize the API client in [`api/client.py`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/api/client.py) to connect to your actual device or service.

## Development Guide

### Initialization Script Options

The `initialize.sh` script supports both interactive and unattended modes:

**Interactive mode** (recommended for first-time users):

```bash
./initialize.sh
```

**Dry-run mode** (test without making changes):

```bash
./initialize.sh --dry-run
```

**Unattended mode** (for automation):

```bash
./initialize.sh \
  --domain my_awesome_device \
  --title "My Awesome Device" \
  --repo myusername/my-hacs-integration \
  --author "Your Name" \
  --force
```

The script will:

- ✅ Validate your domain name and check for conflicts with existing integrations
- ✅ Replace all placeholders (`ha_integration_domain`, `Integration Blueprint`, etc.)
- ✅ Rename the custom_components directory to match your domain
- ✅ Update the LICENSE with your name and current year
- ✅ Replace README.md with a customized version from README.template.md
- ✅ Delete itself and the template files after completion

### Development scripts

This repository uses the [Scripts to Rule Them All](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) pattern for consistency and ease of use. All scripts use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for faster dependency management.

#### Setup & Maintenance

- **`script/setup/bootstrap`** - First-time setup after cloning (installs dependencies and pre-commit hooks)
- **`script/setup/setup`** - Complete project setup (runs bootstrap + additional configuration)
- **`script/setup/reset`** - Reset development environment to fresh state
- **`script/setup/sync-hacs`** - Sync HACS-installed integrations to `custom_components/` for development

#### Development

- **`script/develop`** - Start Home Assistant in development mode with your integration loaded
- **`script/test`** - Run project tests with pytest
  - Add `--cov` for coverage report, `--cov-html` for HTML report in `htmlcov/`
  - Pass any pytest options: `script/test -v -k test_name`
- **`script/lint`** - Run Ruff linting and auto-format code
- **`script/lint-check`** - Check linting without making changes (for CI)
- **`script/type-check`** - Run Pyright type checking
- **`script/spell`** - Run spell checking and fix spelling issues
- **`script/spell-check`** - Check spelling without making changes (for CI)
- **`script/check`** - Run type checking, linting, and spell checking (useful before commits)
- **`script/clean`** - Clean up development artifacts and caches
- **`script/help`** - Display all available scripts with descriptions

#### VS Code tasks

The project includes pre-configured VS Code tasks for common operations. Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` (or `Cmd+Shift+B` on macOS) to see available tasks like "Run Home Assistant (Development Mode)", "Run Tests", "Lint", etc.

**Note for new integrations:** When you run `./initialize.sh`, it will automatically replace this `README.md` with the content from `README.template.md`, customized with your integration's details.

### Package-based architecture

This blueprint uses a **package-based structure** where each major component is organized into its own package (directory with `__init__.py`):

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **Better organization** - Related code is grouped together
- ✅ **Easier to maintain** - Each package has a clear responsibility
- ✅ **Scalable** - Easy to add new entities or features without creating monolithic files
- ✅ **Clear boundaries** - Each platform, utility, and handler has its own namespace

**Platform packages:**

Each platform (sensor, binary_sensor, switch, etc.) is a package containing:

- `__init__.py` - Platform setup with `async_setup_entry()` function
- Individual entity files - One file per entity type (e.g., `air_quality.py`, `connectivity.py`)

**Other packages:**

- **`api/`** - API client and exceptions
- **`config_flow_handler/`** - All config flow logic, schemas, and validators
- **`entity_utils/`** - Shared entity helpers (device info, state calculations)
- **`services/`** - Service registration and handlers (e.g., `example_service.py`)
- **`utils/`** - General utility functions (string helpers, validators, etc.)

---

## Integration Features

This section explains the key features and patterns used in this integration blueprint.

### Config flow

The config flow is organized in the [`config_flow_handler/`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/config_flow_handler/) package. Users can:

- Add the integration through Settings → Devices & Services
- Enter credentials (or other configuration)
- The config flow validates input before creating a config entry
- Reconfigure credentials later without removing and re-adding

**Package structure:**

- [`handler.py`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/config_flow_handler/handler.py) - Base handler with shared logic
- [`config_flow.py`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/config_flow_handler/config_flow.py) - User setup flow
- [`options_flow.py`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/config_flow_handler/options_flow.py) - Options flow for reconfiguration
- [`subentry_flow.py`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/config_flow_handler/subentry_flow.py) - Subentry flow for multi-device setups
- [`schemas/`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/config_flow_handler/schemas/) - Voluptuous schemas for input validation
- [`validators/`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/config_flow_handler/validators/) - Custom validators

**Key features:**

- Input validation with custom error messages
- Unique ID to prevent duplicate entries
- Reconfiguration support via options flow
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages

### DataUpdateCoordinator

The [`coordinator.py`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/coordinator.py) file efficiently manages data fetching:

- **Single API call**: Instead of each entity polling separately, the coordinator fetches data once
- **Shared data**: All entities receive the same data, reducing API load
- **Error handling**: Handles authentication failures and communication errors consistently
- **Automatic updates**: Polls at regular intervals (configurable in `__init__.py`)

This is the recommended pattern in Home Assistant Core for any integration that polls an API.

### Translation keys

All user-facing strings use translation keys instead of hardcoded English text. See [`translations/en.json`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/translations/en.json).

**Benefits:**

- Easy to add more languages
- Consistent terminology across integrations
- Users see text in their configured language

The config flow, entity states, and error messages all support translations.

### Diagnostics

The [`diagnostics.py`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/diagnostics.py) file provides debug information that users can download from the UI:

- Device information
- Configuration details (with sensitive data redacted)
- Coordinator data for troubleshooting
- Integration version and metadata

Users can share this file when reporting issues without exposing passwords or tokens.

### Entity platforms

The blueprint includes multiple entity types organized as packages to demonstrate different patterns:

**Sensors** ([`sensor/`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/sensor/))

- Shows how to create sensors with state values
- Demonstrates state classes and device classes
- Examples:
  - [`air_quality.py`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/sensor/air_quality.py) - Air quality index sensor
  - [`diagnostic.py`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/sensor/diagnostic.py) - Diagnostic sensor

**Binary Sensors** ([`binary_sensor/`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/binary_sensor/))

- Shows binary (on/off) sensors
- Uses device classes for proper icons
- Examples:
  - [`connectivity.py`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/binary_sensor/connectivity.py) - Connectivity status
  - [`filter.py`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/binary_sensor/filter.py) - Filter replacement indicator

**Switches** ([`switch/`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/switch/))

- Shows controllable entities that interact with the API
- Implements `turn_on` and `turn_off` methods
- Demonstrates error handling for control commands
- Example: [`example_switch.py`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/switch/example_switch.py) - Example switch entity

**Select Entities** ([`select/`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/select/))

- Shows dropdown selection entities
- Example: [`fan_speed.py`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/select/fan_speed.py) - Fan speed selector

**Number Entities** ([`number/`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/number/))

- Shows numeric input entities
- Example: [`target_humidity.py`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/number/target_humidity.py) - Target humidity setter

**Button Entities** ([`button/`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/button/))

- Shows action button entities
- Example: [`reset_filter.py`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/button/reset_filter.py) - Filter reset button

**Fan Entities** ([`fan/`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/fan/))

- Shows fan control entities
- Example: [`air_purifier_fan.py`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/fan/air_purifier_fan.py) - Air purifier fan control

Each platform package shows best practices for entity setup, naming, and data handling.

### API client

The API client is organized in the [`api/`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/api/) package:

**Modern patterns:**

- Uses `asyncio.timeout` instead of deprecated `async_timeout` (required for HA 2025.7+)
- Proper async/await throughout
- Custom exception classes for different error types
- Type hints for better IDE support

**Error handling:**

- `IntegrationBlueprintApiClientError` - Base exception for all API errors
- `IntegrationBlueprintApiClientAuthenticationError` - Invalid credentials (401/403)
- `IntegrationBlueprintApiClientCommunicationError` - Network or connection errors

Replace the dummy API calls in [`api/client.py`](custom_components/ha_integration_domain/api/client.py) with your actual device/service API.

### Development container

The [`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) configures a complete development environment:

**What's included:**

- Python 3.13 (matching Home Assistant Core requirements)
- Node.js LTS (for frontend development if needed)
- GitHub CLI pre-installed
- All VS Code extensions configured (Python, Ruff, YAML, etc.)
- Home Assistant 2025.11+ automatically installed
- HACS pre-installed and configured
- Automatic port forwarding for Home Assistant (port 8123)

**First startup:**

The container runs `script/setup/setup` automatically, which:

1. Creates a Python virtual environment
2. Installs all dependencies
3. Downloads Home Assistant
4. Sets up HACS
5. Installs pre-commit hooks

Just wait for the setup to complete (check the terminal), then run `script/develop`.

### AI agent support

This blueprint is optimized for development with AI coding assistants like **GitHub Copilot**, **Claude**, and other AI agents:

**Comprehensive instructions:**

- **`AGENTS.md`** - Primary instruction file for all AI agents (project overview, code patterns, workflows)
- **`.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`** - Path-specific instructions for different file types:
  - `python.instructions.md` - Python code style and patterns
  - `yaml.instructions.md` - YAML file conventions
  - `json.instructions.md` - JSON file formatting
  - `manifest.instructions.md` - Integration manifest requirements
  - `services.instructions.md` - Service definition patterns
  - `translations.instructions.md` - Translation file structure
  - `tests.instructions.md` - Test writing guidelines
- **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** - GitHub Copilot-specific guidance

**What these instructions provide:**

- Integration-specific naming and structure guidelines
- Home Assistant Core development patterns and best practices
- Code quality baselines (type hints, async patterns, error handling)
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Project-specific conventions and architectural decisions
- Task tracking and workflow patterns for complex multi-step work

**Benefits for AI-assisted development:**

- ✅ **Consistent code quality** - AI agents understand project standards and generate code that passes validation
- ✅ **Reduced iteration** - Instructions help agents make correct decisions on first try
- ✅ **Home Assistant patterns** - Agents know integration-specific requirements and Core best practices
- ✅ **Context-aware suggestions** - File-specific instructions ensure appropriate patterns for each context
- ✅ **Faster development** - Less back-and-forth, more productive coding sessions

**Usage:**

Most AI agents will automatically discover and use these instruction files. GitHub Copilot reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md` by default, while other agents typically respect `AGENTS.md` and path-specific `.instructions.md` files.

When working with AI assistants, you can reference these instructions explicitly (e.g., "Follow the patterns in AGENTS.md") or let the agent discover them automatically.

**Maintaining instructions:**

As your integration evolves, keep these instruction files updated. They should reflect your actual patterns and decisions, not just theoretical guidelines. When you establish new conventions or change approaches, update the relevant instruction files so AI agents stay aligned with your project's direction.

### Pre-commit hooks

The repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically check code before commits:

**What's checked:**

- Ruff formatting (auto-fixes)
- Ruff linting (auto-fixes when possible)
- YAML syntax
- JSON syntax
- Trailing whitespace
- File endings

Hooks are installed automatically by `script/setup/bootstrap`. Run manually with:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Testing infrastructure

The blueprint includes a complete test setup:

**Tools provided:**

- `pytest` for running tests
- `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` for Home Assistant-specific fixtures
- `pytest-asyncio` for async test support
- `pytest-cov` for coverage reporting

**Add your own tests:**
Create test files in the `tests/` directory. Example:

```python
"""Test integration setup."""
from homeassistant.core import HomeAssistant
from pytest_homeassistant_custom_component.common import MockConfigEntry

async def test_setup_entry(hass: HomeAssistant) -> None:
    """Test setting up the integration."""
    entry = MockConfigEntry(domain="ha_integration_domain", data={...})
    assert await hass.config_entries.async_setup(entry.entry_id)
```

Run tests with `script/test` or `script/test --cov` for coverage.

### Type checking and linting

This blueprint uses the same tools as Home Assistant Core:

**Ruff** (replaces Black, isort, flake8, and more)

- Fast linter and formatter written in Rust
- Automatically fixes many issues
- Configuration in `pyproject.toml` matches Core standards
- Run with `script/lint`

**Pyright** (type checker)

- Checks type hints for errors
- Helps catch bugs before runtime
- Configuration in `pyproject.toml`
- Run with `script/type-check`

Both tools are integrated into pre-commit hooks and the dev container.

While this blueprint is inspired by the original, it includes significant enhancements:

| Feature | This Blueprint | Original Blueprint |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Home Assistant version** | 2025.7+ (latest) | Older versions (may not work with 2025.7+) |
| **Python version** | 3.13+ | 3.12 |
| **Timeout handling** | `asyncio.timeout` (modern) | `async_timeout` (deprecated) |
| **Package manager** | uv (fast) | pip (standard) |
| **Development scripts** | Comprehensive Scripts to Rule Them All | Basic scripts |
| **Test infrastructure** | `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` | Manual test setup needed |
| **Type checking** | Pyright configured | Not included |
| **Linting** | Ruff (Core-aligned config) | Ruff (basic config) |
| **HACS integration** | Auto-installed in dev container | Manual setup |
| **VS Code tasks** | Pre-configured tasks for common operations | Not included |
| **Package architecture** | Organized into packages for scalability | Single-file platforms |
| **AI agent support** | Comprehensive instructions for GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc. | Not included |

Both blueprints share the same core concepts (config flow, coordinator, entity platforms), but this one is more closely aligned with how Home Assistant Core is developed today.

### Next steps

Once you have the blueprint working with your device or service:

#### Testing & quality

- **Add tests**: Use `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` to test your config flow, coordinator, and entities
- **Run type checking**: Ensure `script/type-check` passes without errors
- **Test with real Home Assistant**: Install via HACS or copy to your real HA instance

#### Branding & distribution

- **Add brand images**: Submit logo and icon to [home-assistant/brands](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands)
- **Write documentation**: Update this README with your integration's specific features
- **Create releases**: Tag versions and publish releases on GitHub

#### Share & Connect

- **Share your work**: Post on the [Home Assistant Forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/)
- **Submit to HACS**: Follow the [HACS documentation](https://hacs.xyz/docs/publish/start) to make your integration discoverable
- **Contribute**: If your integration would benefit many users, consider [submitting it to Home Assistant Core](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/creating_integration_manifest)
