# Contribution guidelines

Contributing to this project should be as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## GitHub is used for everything

GitHub is used to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Run `script/setup/bootstrap` to install dependencies and pre-commit hooks.
3. If you've changed something, update the documentation.
4. Make sure your code passes all checks (using `script/check` for linting and type checking).
5. Test your contribution.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](../../issues)

GitHub issues are used to track public bugs.
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

This project uses:

- [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting
- [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) for type checking

Run `script/check` to lint and type-check your code before submitting, or `script/lint` to auto-format and fix linting issues.

## Test your code modification

This project comes with a complete development environment in a container, easy to launch
if you use Visual Studio Code. With this container you will have a standalone
Home Assistant instance running and already configured with the included
[`configuration.yaml`](./config/configuration.yaml) file.

You can also run tests using `script/test` to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.
